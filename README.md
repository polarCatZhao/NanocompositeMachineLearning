# NanocompositeMachineLearning
I used Word2Vec in Gensim to create word embeddings for material science papers collected by Clair Lin of the Brinson Lab and visualized the word embeddings with the t-SNE algorithm. I also created a similarity matrix of different materials based on their cosine similarity and plotted similarity graphs based on that matrix. Other than the unstructured data of material science papers, I also did work with a structured dataset extracted out of those papers by Clair Lin and others from the Brinson Lab. I preprocessed the dataset with techniques such as One Hot, fitted different models like linear models, decision tree and neural network to data and visualized data with seaborn plots. I collaborated with material scientists extensively on this project. Defended this project in front of a committee of 2 computer science professors and 1 material science professor and passed the defense.
